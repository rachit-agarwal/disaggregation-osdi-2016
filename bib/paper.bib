    Abstract = {Current trends in cloud computing, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things are driving huge demand for increased computing power. To continue to sustain performance gains, systems are starting to use chips with multiple, discrete processing units to distribute workloads. The individual parts have to work together as a whole, and thus need to communicate. Most systems use a network of routers to move data between multiple cores and memories, and these routers often become the performance bottleneck. Our project is thus to design a high radix router which will enable more efficient communication and further performance gains.}
